# random_music_cli 0.1.0

*Core db will be uploaded later, stay tuned!*
*for now you can use this app to create your own db with songs*

This is simple Rust program to choose some songs to play.
It's CLI application so I can not imagine someone using this
seriosly. It is just a base for future web-app and telegram bot.
Also, all of the code was written using termux, so shoutot to the
creators for such opportunity :)

## Philosophy of the app

This application is aiming at fixing boring party set-lists
of guitar songs. Because for years, when i'm picking up guitar
I cannot choose what to play, I've decided to create this app.
It should provide simple(almoust one-button-stupid) expirience.
It should provide musicians with nonordinary set of songs to play.
It should provide chords to songs.

## More detailed explanation on performanse

When you run this program it randomly chooses one song from
a large database, sends you link to tabs/chords
You can add/remove songs from that database
(in concept of telegram bot, some supervision will be required on our side)
